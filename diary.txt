Todo
[x] Moveable character, basic rectangle is fine
    [x] Simple collision detection for walls and goal
    [x] Can touch goal to re-generate map
[x] Array for map
    [x] different value for character, goal, walls, and empty space
    [x] 2D? (might as well)
[ ] Random Depth-first search algorithm
    [x] Make "head" position
    [x] Array of past position
        [x] Keep check of current position in array ^
    [x] Choose random available direction
        [x] stdlib rand + modulus + switch
    [x] Check which paths are possible
        [x] Make struct to keep each direction
        [x] Function to update struct values
    [x] Backtrack when at a dead end
        [x] Keep check of dead ends, to put goal in afterwards
    [x] Check when all possible positions have been visited
    [x] Make a goal in a dead end
    [-] Doors + Keys?
        (The game is hard enough to beat(impossible) as it is)
[x] Points 
    [x] Make points appear over screen (change alpha values)

I can't be bothered to redo my previous maze to fix the 318018 bug again, so 
I'mma just make a new maze-maker instead. I'm already over the deadline, so 
might as well make something quick and easy.
Depth-search it is.
I copied most of my empty map-generating code from the previous one, 
seeing how it's the same either way, though I now make it a 2d array instead.

My brother had his birthday party yesterday. I joined him and his freinds as 
a chaperone to Gr√∂na Lund.  No regrets.
With map and character basics done I do the rest. Making the algorithm was 
way easier than my previous attempts without any possible way for the 318 bug 
again, even without watching any guides.

Colour change + I made the character a slight bit smaller than the walls, so 
he's nicer to look at.
I noticed a few issues with how the goal is placed, and issues in general with
the algorithms choice of movement. It took about an hour of printf but it's now
fixed. I don't think there is anything more to do.
(No, I'm not making doors. That'd be cruel.)
